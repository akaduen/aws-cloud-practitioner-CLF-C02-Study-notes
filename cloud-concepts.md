# AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) - Cloud Concepts

---

## Defining Cloud Computing
- Supplies computing resources (servers, storage, databases) via the internet, accessible instantly, with costs tied to usage.
- **Core Characteristics (NIST):**
  - Self-service access: Provision resources independently without manual intervention.
  - Universal connectivity: Usable from any internet-enabled location.
  - Shared infrastructure: Resources pooled among multiple users for efficiency.
  - Flexible scaling: Expands or contracts rapidly based on needs.
  - Usage-based billing: Charges reflect actual consumption, tracked automatically.

## Key Benefits
- **Speed:** Deploy services in minutes instead of weeks.
- **Adaptability:** Scales seamlessly with workload fluctuations.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Shifts from capital expenses (e.g., hardware purchases) to operational costs.
- **Simplified Management:** AWS manages infrastructure, allowing focus on development.

## Cloud Deployment Types
- **Public:** Multi-tenant environment shared across users (e.g., AWS cloud).
- **Private:** Exclusive setup for a single organization (e.g., company-owned servers with virtualization).
- **Hybrid:** Combines public and private setups (e.g., AWS Outposts for on-premises integration).

## Service Categories
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Offers complete resource control (e.g., EC2 for virtual machines).
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Streamlines app development without server oversight (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk).
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Fully managed software solutions (e.g., Google Workspace).

## Why AWS Stands Out
- Extensive global network with regions and availability zones for low-latency access.
- Industry pioneer, providing a vast and innovative service portfolio.
